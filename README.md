# Book List Application
Simple React/Redux project to browse through books and view their details

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a local copy on your machine which you can then run and use. These steps assumes you have npm installed already. If you don't, here is the [installation guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) to get started.

```
git clone https://github.com/mariesta/ReduxProject.git
npm install
npm start
```

Look for the line 'Project is running at [localhost url]'. If you navigate to this url, you should see this.

You can then click on one of the book and view something similar to:

Enjoy!
